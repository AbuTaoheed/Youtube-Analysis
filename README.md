## Tools 
- Python (Jupyter IDE)
  - Data cleaning
  - Data Analysis
  - Data visualization

## Data Cleaning/Preparation
In the data cleaning and preparation phase, the following tasks were performed:
1. Data loading and inspection
2. Handling missing values and duplicates
3. Data cleaning and formating 

## Exploratory Analysis 
EDA involved exploration to answer and reveal the following:
1. What type of sentiments are expressed in comments? (using sentiment polarity analysis)
2. What are he most used words by users in video comments? (using wordcloud analysis)
3. What emoji's did users use most in their comments? (using emoji analysis)
4. Which content categories has the most likes?
5. Are audience engaged? (using regression and heatmap to find correlation between views and likes)
6. Which channels have the most trending videos? (using simple frequency and groupby techniques)
7. Does number of puctuations in video titles have impact on views? (using the string.punctuation package)

## Data Analysis
1. What type of sentiments are expressed in comments?
```
from textblob import TextBlob
polarity = []
for comment in sample_df['comment_text']:
    try:
        polarity.append(TextBlob(comment).sentiment.polarity)
    except:
        polarity.append(0)
sample_df['polarity'] = polarity
positivePol = sample_df['polarity'] == 1
negativePol = sample_df['polarity'] == -1
sample_df_pos_comments = sample_df[positivePol]
sample_df_neg_comments = sample_df[negativePol]
```

2. What are he most used words by users in video comments?
```
from wordcloud import WordCloud, STOPWORDS
PositiveCommentsStr = ' '.join(sample_df_pos_comments['comment_text'])
PosWordCloud = WordCloud(stopwords=set(STOPWORDS)).generate(PositiveCommentsStr)
plt.imshow(PosWordCloud)
plt.axis('off')
```

## Results and Findings
1. What type of sentiments are expressed in comments? (using sentiment polarity analysis)
2. What are he most used words by users in video comments? (using wordcloud analysis)
3. What emoji's did users use most in their comments? (using emoji analysis)
4. Which content categories has the most likes?
5. Are audience engaged? (using regression and heatmap to find correlation between views and likes)
   - 
7. Which channels have the most trending videos? (using simple frequency and groupby techniques)
   - Conclusion:
     - The top 5 channels with trending videos
       
|Channel|No. Trending videos|
|-------|-------------------|
|The Late Show with Stephen Colbert|710|
|WWE|643|
|Late Night with Seth Meyers|592|
|TheEllenShow|555|
|Jimmy Kimmel Live|528|

7. Does number of puctuations in video titles have impact on views?
   - Conclusion:
     - Likes are higher for titles with 2, 3 and 5 punctuation marks
     - Views are higher for titles with 2 or 3 punctuation marks
