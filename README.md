## Tools 
- Python (Jupyter IDE)
  - Data cleaning
  - Data Analysis
  - Data visualization
- Special Packages used
  - Textblob(Sentiment.polarity)
  - Wordcloud
  - String.punctuations
  - Emoji

## Data Cleaning and Preparation
In the data cleaning and preparation phase, the following tasks were performed:
1. Data loading and inspection
2. Handling missing values and duplicates
3. Data formating and transformation

## Exploratory Analysis 
EDA involved exploration to answer and reveal the following:
1. What type of sentiments are expressed in comments? (using sentiment polarity analysis)
2. What are the most used words by users in video comments? (using wordcloud analysis)
3. What emoji's did users use most in their comments? (using emoji analysis)
4. Which content categories has the most likes?
5. Are audience engaged? (using regression and heatmap to find correlation between views and likes)
6. Which channels have the most trending videos? (using simple frequency and groupby techniques)
7. Does number of puctuations in video titles have impact on views? (using the string.punctuation package)

## Data Analysis
1. Analyzing sentiments expressed in comments?
```
from textblob import TextBlob
polarity = []
for comment in sample_df['comment_text']:
    try:
        polarity.append(TextBlob(comment).sentiment.polarity)
    except:
        polarity.append(0)
sample_df['polarity'] = polarity
positivePol = sample_df['polarity'] == 1
negativePol = sample_df['polarity'] == -1
sample_df_pos_comments = sample_df[positivePol]
sample_df_neg_comments = sample_df[negativePol]
```

2. Analyzing words most used by users in video comments?
```
from wordcloud import WordCloud, STOPWORDS
PositiveCommentsStr = ' '.join(sample_df_pos_comments['comment_text'])
PosWordCloud = WordCloud(stopwords=set(STOPWORDS)).generate(PositiveCommentsStr)
plt.imshow(PosWordCloud)
plt.axis('off')
```

## Results and Findings
1. Sentiments expressed in comments.
   - 10% of comments expressed positive sentiments whike 3% expressed negative comments. Over 85% of the comments were neutral.
2. Most important words used in comments.
   - Words like 'Best', 'Awesome' and 'Great' were most positive words used while words such as 'Terrible', 'Worst' and 'Boring' were the most negative words used in the comments
