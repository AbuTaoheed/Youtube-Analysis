101,cLdxuaxaQwc,"I am seeing so much idiocy and lack of self awareness in these comments. Let me hit you all with some knowledge: the N word is not okay to say because it has body counts and a huge amount of human suffering attached to it. The word goes back to slave owning days, same as the N word with no hard r. Black folks can say the word because it is theirs to reclaim. I'm a person of color and that word is not in my vocabulary. Why? Because I'm not black, and I'm aware of the oppression tied to this word. I'm also not a piss baby arguing why I should be able to use such a gross word because again, this word is not mine to reclaim. So yeah, it's fine when all these black rappers use the word because it's a part of their personal history. As a grown ass woman I am still in disbelief that people can't have a pinch of empathy for their fellow human beings. If you're not black, you are irrelevant in the conversation of whether you can say the n word. You can't, bottom line, and if you're still arguing your right to say it, well then I have news for you: you're a racist.",0,0,0.03907738095238096

Why if we have the technology of cloud seeding through laser shooting at particles to create rain and we been manipulating the weather for decades now. Why didn't we redirected or stopped the hurricanes? \n\nEven famous physicists Michio Kaku admits to this geoengenering on a cbs news interview.  \nI wish it didn't happen and all natural disasters are a horrible thing for anyone to endure. And my heart goes out to all the victims and will continue to support. But it is so sad to find out that tragic events like this can be man made at times. So I pray that many of you become aware of what's really taking place in this reality and give your life to God, he won't disappoint you. \nAnd I pray that this whole event about helping is not just an agenda to promote and push coexistence, globalism and unity. Their religion of occult  New Age/mysticism and rise of their Antichrist/alien god to bring their New World Order, which they believe, chaos must be created in order to bring Order. Where with their mind witch powers and advance alien/demon technology they can create  almost anything they can imagine. \nDon't get me wrong please, helping is awesome as I'm praying for everyone including the celebrities participating and even those who have sold their souls for riches and fame, is not to late for redemption! I'm praying for you. But really hope this is not all orchestrated for a different agenda, don't forget that the road to hell is paved with good intentions. Time to read our Bibles and take a close look at  the book of Revelation chapter 13,  Daniel 12 and Luke 21.\nStay strong Texas, Florida, all the Caribbean and to all those affected. May you find peace and joy in Christ Jesus even in the middle of the struggles. Remember man and Satan  can only hurt the physical body or the material but can't never have our souls if we believe we are Gods children and the only way to be redeemed and adopted into Gods family is by Jesus Christ our Savior, there's no short cuts and Satan is a liar so don't fall for the lies because religion kills and condemns the soul, only a true relationship with Father God through Jesus saves.

I explained my problem to my friend and she suggested that I should rather contact a spell caster that could help me cast a spell to bring him back but I am the type that never believed in spell, I had no choice than to try it, I mailed the spell caster, and he told me there was no problem that everything will be okay before three days, that my ex will return to me before three days, he cast the spell and surprisingly in the second day, it was around 4 pm. My ex called me, I was so surprised, I answered the call and all he said was that he was so sorry for everything that happened that he wanted me to return to him, that he loves me so much. I was so happy and went to him that was how we started living together happily again. Since then, I have made promise that anybody I know that have a relationship problem, I would be of help to such person by referring him or her to the only real and powerful spell caster who helped me with my own problem.

Unfortunately for Colin, the camera angle right before he asks Heidi to say stop reveals a white item cupped in his right hand (this is of course the magical list of 3 items - Rome/Cheese/Ellen - about to be pressed onto the printed paper wherever she says stop). To see this white item, you'll have to watch the DVR version of the TV broadcast as this internet version has been edited by AGT to remove this reveal. At 03:06, Colin brings this small piece of paper from his right pocket with his right hand.

It will be a well-executed device and likely be a big winner, sales wise (despite the price) even if they're just now catching up in some areas.  \n\nImpressed by:\n-chipset. They were already beating all competition here with the 7. Bench numbers look amazing and every day performance will likely follow suit. \n\n-software: photo options, UI with no home button looks super easy to adapt to\n\n-4K@60 and slomo. Damn tech is getting impressive across the board here. \n\n-fit and finish and presentation. The package is pleasing to me overall. I don't mind the notch at all. \n\nI was a bit disappointed by a few things:\n\n-screen brightness. Boo! \n-no promotion/120hz refresh\n-fuck 2x optical zoom. Samsung and Apple, get your shit together and give me something more useful here. \n\nI've owned both Apple and various android-based devices. In general, I find Apple to hold up better (lag less) and simply be a more fluid and enjoyable experience. Less buggy, more mainstream/supported and compatible with apps like e.g DJIgo4, etc. \n\nI'll probably wait for the next iteration of this one, but I like it. \n\nWhy has no mentioned the absence of the blush gold color option. That was a winner in my book, but not even a whisper? No one seems to be talking about it, especially after all the leaks.",0,0,0.20252976190476188

1821,UCrBICYM0yM,"How can people be excited about this crap? This makes absolutelly NO sense at all. First: Most catastrophes are not caused by overpopulation, but natural disasters. Even if you make the point of carrying capacity in terms of food becoming a problem, it could be tackled by GMOs easier and better. Second: You CAN NOT just shrink people down like this. The size of nucleons are unalterable, because the ranges of the strong and weak nuclear forces are fundamental constants. Reducing the space between nuclei and electrons is impossible because of electromagnetism. And even packing molecules tighter together wouldn't work, as there'd be biochemical problems. Correct protein folding and therefore enzymes would be rendered impossible. Third: How could they metabolize food and drinks not their own size? Their tiny enzymes wouldn't work on normal-sized molecules. I'd say if you can alter the fundamental universal constants, carrying capacity is no worry any longer, you're basically beyond even a kardashev III civilization by then. \n\nThis isn't even original, as some say. The shrinking trope has been done to death!\nAnd before someone points out this is supposed to be a comedy: Even a comedy needs suspension of disbelief. Also, it may be because I hate Hollywood comedy to the death, but at least for me they're always the same. Clichee-filled crude humor fests with plots of idiocy.

Se trata de una de las canciones que quedaron guardadas cuando la banda británica estaba componiendo uno de los álbumes más influyentes de su carrera: El OK Computer (1997).\nDos décadas después, el tema vio la luz en OKNOTOK. La reedición incluye el disco original, las 8 caras b y tres temas inéditos que el grupo ha tocado en directo pero cuyas versiones de estudio jamás han visto la luz. Estas son “Man of War” y “I Promise“ y Lift, todas ya con su correspondiente nuevo vídeoclip.\nLas imágenes de Lift están dirigidas por el británico Oscar Hudson, que ha trabajado con la banda desde el lanzamiento de A Moon Shaped Pool (2016). En este vídeoclip vemos un surrealista viaje en ascensor protagonizado por el vocalista del grupo, Thom Yorke.  En el trayecto se encuentra con diversos personajes y situaciones, pero como se indica en la canción, no todo es lo que parece.\nMúsica independiente novedades.",0,0,0.4583333333333333

Distances here are really shorter and the major advantage of train stations is that as they were pretty much all built in the late 1800's/early 1900's at the periphery of cities, they are now the heart of the cities. You get down the train and you are immediately where you need to be (most of the times with a lot of easy public transportations). Take Paris for example : its 4 majors train stations are all in the middle of the city while you need at least 30 more minutes to get back from airports to the centre (not even counting the checks and everything).

Fossil fuels and nuclear power are the cheapest forms of dispatchable power we have. \n\nThat said, with a large nuclear power fleet, we can create synthgas from seawater, the US Navy research labs have already proven this technology (think refueling planes on an aircraft carrier). Using cheap clean nuclear power to create a carton neutral high energy density fuel (much higher than any battery by many factors) is a much better solution and a much more likely one. If oil price goes up synthgas will be able to make serious money with an installed fleet so large that it's not going anywhere fast.",0,0,0.16136904761904763

It is true that we might have decades of fossile fuels left over, but we can’t ever burn that all if we would want to keep this planet an inhabitable home for many further generations.\n\nThe plane of the future in my subjective opinion is a zero-emission, perhaps solar-powered or at least “green” energy loaded aircraft with about the capacity of a rather small long-haul airliner and the range of this new Boeing 797 concept.\nBy 2030 already, we will have about 1,000,000,000 more people living on earth than now and this leads me to being concerned more about the regular medium to short-haul travel than a couple transatlantic flights.\nThere will be a point when our usual short to medium-haul airliners like the 737 will not be capable of running the routes they fly anymore because of capacity issues. More and more people are living on earth and the percentage of people using air traffic as their mean of transport is increasing just as quick.\nAirlines like Swiss, Austrian and British already use 777s and 767s for routes like Vienna - Frankfurt, Zurich - Vienna and London - Amsterdam. And that is only one of countless flights on these routes each day. If zero-emission aircraft don’t become a reality, running larger capacity, fuel efficient planes a couple less times a day rather than more low-capacity aircraft will over a long course perhaps be the better solution for our planet, air congestion, those affected by aircraft noise and so on and so forth. It may make us dispense with comfort in terms of frequency of flights and travel times, but I don’t think I have to elaborate that our earth is more valuable than arriving somewhere one hour earlier or later.",2,0,0.14060292777398042

3244,GGm0FQ6i74U,"One of Hillary's problems is that her positions on issues may have seemed more grounded, by they also didn't solve the problem. For example: When Sanders talked about public college being free (through a regulatory measure, similar to what is done in the UK), Hillary's proposal was tuition free college in which tax credits would be given to help subsidize the cost of college, but only for families below a certain income bracket. So you have tax money being used for college credits for certain people, which does nothing to actually curb the out-of-control costs of college education. All it does is give colleges an excuse to increase their tuition rates because now, the money would be coming from the government instead of students. \n\nAnother example: Universal Healthcare. Hillary said, 90% of people are covered, so it's easier to just get the other 10%. Maybe. But the 90% don't all have good, or affordable coverage. They're just covered. The plan of extending Obamacare further doesn't do anything to actually curb the out-of-control costs of healthcare, because her plan continued to see cooperation with the money-sucking insurance companies.

You need to learn to appeal to different crowds while still maintaining a focus on your agenda items.\n\nIt wasn't that Hillary didn't have that focus - I think she expended far too much energy in maintaining it, and not enough on figuring out what crowds wanted, or how to tailor her speeches so that both laypeople and those in-the-know would get a sense of who she was as a person and leader.\n\nThe end result of the loss can be blamed on the timing of a variety of events and the presence of a variety of scandals, real or imagined, but a large part of the responsibility lies with how she chose to run a data-centric, cold-and-clinical campaign. I hope future leaders learn from her missteps.\n\nAs for her commentary on Obama and her husband...I don't think they ran anywhere near as clinically as she believes.

But that's not gonna happen...her eyes are gonna be rolled back in her head so far she'll be seeing the northern lights as I stroke and stroke and stroke and stroke until my legs give out and I collapse onto the floor and cry like a baby begging for her to get up and climb down off the chair and ride me like evel kenevil flying over some cars until she crashes into the pile of me below...sweat pouring off her sharp chin...hair falling around my face....i drink her sweat and run my hands up her hard abs as she's bending and crushing my tower like penis on her every stroke like she's some kind of shined hillbilly playing a saw at the county fair..I feel it bend and spring out inside her actually hitting her uterus as she stretches upward moaning the hot sweat of the night air and open windows rolling on her body filling my belly button like I've spilled my silky seed on it...as she climaxes she starts speaking in some foreign language which I later find out is the mental limit between the physical and the ethereal and she explodes in orgasm so hard she turns in to a mid air splash of pure Florida orange juice and I'm left lying in my tight blue Levi's with no shirt on in my trailer and I wake up and realize I'm just drunk and hallucinating but there is orange juice everywhere....and maybe she was there...and maybe she wasn't....but I'm thankful for my vintage heather blue Levi's orange tab boot cut vintage jeans...if I hadn't had them on with a thick leather belt...I might've put a hole in my trailer wall....all I'm saying...is that gwenyth Paltrow....in this one second I'm seeing you...you make me wanna tear you apart...I'm not saying you're beautiful or ugly or pretty or nice...I don't know what it is...but...you got what this man needs....that's all I'm saying.

Yeah well I had to insert gwenyth Paltrow into it because she's fucking exploder right here...I know you were the one in the dress when I met you and it was silver not gold and you're not gwenyth Paltrow but...if I could get a hold of gwenyth Paltrow right now...well..I damn sure wouldn't be saying hi to you...you snotty evasive tart...),0,0,-0.016990165631469992

4021,qJJHhVf3_ZM,"I think Gwyneth Paltrow is pretty hot, like most straight guys probably do, but to promote her BS lifestyle magazine / whatever is reprehensible. GOOP basically takes advantage of misinformed people, that spend money they don't have to buy things they don't need, don't work, may be harmful, and are overpriced, because they somehow trust Paltrow for advice. Some examples of snake oil scams promoted recently by the magazine: 1. Wellness stickers from NASA that were publicly discredited by NASA, which confirmed the product has no technology developed by NASA in it. 2. Yoni Jade Eggs, which women are supposed to put inside their vaginas, which in the words of OB-GYN Dr. Gunter could be a risk factor for bacterial vaginosis or even the potentially deadly toxic shock syndrome; and 3. Vaginal Steaming which doctors also call a load of garbage. Just to name a few. They have been repeatedly knocked for false advertising, misleading advertising, and settled lawsuits out of court. It is truly horrifying to see CBS promoting this garbage. I hope CBS is named in future lawsuits that are sure to come as people are injured and/or simply realize they were duped by Paltrow and GOOP.",0,0,0.03333333333333334
